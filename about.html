					Volta EV Limited is a startup founded 2017 in Lagos on the premise of accelerating Nigeria’s automobile industry towards cleaner forms of sustainable 
					transportation. We are a fully registered private company limited by shares with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with RC Number: 145548. 
					<br><br>
					Despite the global call for active actions against the effects of climate change, 99% of vehicles driven in Nigeria are fossil fuel driven. Looking at 
					the great strides made in the Electric Vehicle industries by various American, European and Asian companies, it is quite evident that the age of fossil 
					vehicles is at it’s dusk. More so, Nigeria is the 146th nation to sign the Paris Climate Agreement.
					<br><br>					
					To this effect, we have made it the core of our vision while fully understanding the various unique constraints we might face, to design and manufacture 
					efficient and affordable Electric Vehicles primarily for the largest economy in Africa.
					<br><br>					
					We believe Nigeria is ripe and ready for an energy responsible future even though the major need of most Nigerians is guaranteed 24hours powers supply, 
					which seem to be lacking all across the nation. It is in our mission to bring innovative products to the market to alleviate and ultimately solve these issues.
